# Payroll

APIs: Please implement REST (follow best practices) APIs that will allow us to do the following:
– Create an employee for a company. The gross salary is mandatory at creation
– Update an employee’s gross salary
– Get all company employees
– Get one specific employee by its employee identifier in a company
– Get all employees that are still in a company during a given period
– Calculate a payroll for a company on a provided period: Use an employee list as
request body and the period as request parameter
